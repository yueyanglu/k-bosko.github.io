### Education
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Meteorology & Physical Oceanography at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science](https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/), University of Miami.
I received an undergraduate marine science degree at Ocean University of China in [Qingdao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao).

### Research Interests
My research primarily focuses on how ocean mesoscale eddies influence the tracer distributions and how this effect can be related to large-scale fields. I use theory and idealized and comprehensive numerical models of ocean circulation to tackle these problems.

I am happy to discuss and collaborate with different minds!
